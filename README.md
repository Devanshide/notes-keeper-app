# notes-keeper-app
# Project-Week-5
This is a full-stack *Notes Keeper App* built using the *MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js)*. It allows users to register, log in securely using JWT authentication, and perform full CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) on personal notes. Users can also assign optional tags to their notes. The frontend is built using React without any external CSS frameworks like Tailwind or Bootstrap, styled only with minimal CSS in App.css. The backend handles routing, authentication, and database communication with MongoDB. Both frontend and backend are kept in separate folders.
This is my project submission. All the necessary code files are included.  
If the **node_modules** folder is not present, please run `npm install` to download the required dependencies before running the project.
Then create a .env file in the backend folder with your own MONGO_URI and JWT_SECRET, and start both frontend (npm start) and backend (node server.js) servers. The app runs on http://localhost:3000 (frontend) and connects to http://localhost:5000 (backend API). This project fulfills all core requirements of a mini project, including authentication, protected routes, note management, and MongoDB integration.
